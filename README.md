# permutation-group

This should hopefully have a few tools to help explore permutation groups S<sub>n</sub>, working currently with cycle notation i.e. $` \sigma = (1 3) `$ could represent
```math
\sigma = \left(\begin{array}{@{}*{20}{c@{\,}}}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
3 & 2 & 1 & 4 \\
\end{array}\right)
```
in two-line notation (upper line becomes the lower one).
